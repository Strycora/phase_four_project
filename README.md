# phase_four_project - Favorite Places

Favorite Places is a SPA (single page application) that allows users to document their favorite places. Users can enter the name of the place, a text description, and an image URL to add some color. Users are able to Create, Read and Delete places and Create and Read comments for each place. 

# Installation

Run 'bundle install' and 'rails db:migrate' to install! Navigate into the backend with your terminal and run 'rails s', then index.html and click 'Add a Place' to get started. 

# Usage 

Click on "Add a Place" at the top of the page to render the form to add a place. Enter text for the name and description, and a URL ending with .jpg or another image file type into the Image field. Names and descriptions are required to submit the form, whereas the image URL is optional. Upon submitting the form, you will be redirected to the list of places where the place will be displayed, and you can delete the place or add a text comment.
